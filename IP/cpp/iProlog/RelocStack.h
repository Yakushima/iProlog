// WORK IN PROGRESS

/* Defines a type-parameterized, addressable, relocatable stack with elements of type T,
 * with optional range-checks. A replacement for STL vector.
 * 
 * Purposes:
 * - save space -- the STL vector header is pretty "fat", e.g. 24 bytes
 *				on my 64-bit machine. This one is 8 bytes on the same machine.
 *  			iProlog uses a lot of small arrays, so this matters.
 * 
 * - save time -- getting the C++ compiler to just fetch and use a pointer,
 *				rather than passing a whole struct around during parameter passing and
 *				assignment. The array can be bounds-checked in debug configs, but
 *				that overhead can be dispensed with, in release binaries.
 *				STL vectors also have one level of indirection, so a fetch
 *			    is saved. Space can also be time when caching is considered.
 * 
 * - flexibility -- C++ STL vector is very general. Here, however, we can
 *				allow that array element sizes can be expressed in 8 bits,
 *				and the number of elements in 16 bits. Other configurations
 *				could be specified with typedefs for header member types.
 *				Speed-for-space trades become possible. For example,
 *				if the elements are near enough to a power of two in size,
 *				the array index operator could do a single left shift
 *				on the index. Elements could be aligned on cache block
 *				addresses.
 * 
 * If the class could consist of only a pointer, the
 * optimizer has a better chance of treating an object (not a pointer to it)
 * as a pointer. But there are other data: the storage capacity, and the index
 * to the top of the stack. Relocatability imposes another constraint:
 * sometimes you want the data locked in place prevent relocation, other
 * times you don't care.
 *
 * The STL vector template type uses an indirect,
 * and has a fairly long header with the pointer to the actual relocatable vector data.
 * This might be solved in C style by using malloc, etc. but messily.
